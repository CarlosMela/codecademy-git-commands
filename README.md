**git merge origin/master**

**git push origin branchToBeSendToOrigin**

Push your local branch up to the remote, origin. In the remote repo the branch can be merged to master.

### WORKFLOW:
 1. Fetch and merge changes from the remote
 2. Create a branch to work on a new project feature
 3. Develop the feature on your branch and commit your work
 4. Fetch and merge from the remote again (in case new commits were made while you were working)
 5. Push your branch up to the remote for review

>Steps 1 and 4 are a safeguard against merge conflicts. Step 5 involves git push.
